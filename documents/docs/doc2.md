## Not everything was possible to be finished

I had some problems(i.e a lot of rain in Pernambuco, and a little in my house, but nothing urgent) so i wasnt able to focus 100% in these 2 days.
These were some of features that i wasnt able to implement:

### Favorites page

1. Action to order by release date;
2. Action to check if its on theaters;
3. Action to switch to series(right now it shows both movies and series)
4. I wasnt able to run tests with Jasmine

And some other minor problems like: 

1. You're able to add the same movie as favorite

## Some doubts

I was thinking while i was coding the app and i dont really know if the idea was to have already 15 movies id's hardcoded and then just fetch their data to print or(the way i did) search a specific movie and add each one to favorites. I guess the second way makes more sense.. Sorry if i misunderstood
